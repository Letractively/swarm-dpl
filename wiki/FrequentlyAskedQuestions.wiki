== Did you know that there are other projects called "Swarm"? ==

Yes we did.  We do not believe that 100% uniqueness is a prerequisite for a project name.  Remember that the word "swarm" has been in use for over a thousand years, it wasn't invented by any software project!

If someone can suggest a better name that is unique, then we'll consider it, but for now we're happy with Swarm.
