#summary Swarm's open issues

==Arranging data==
Swarm must find a way to adaptively arrange data on servers to minimize the number of times a thread must jump from one computer to the other.

Ian has posted a proposal for this to our mailing list, but it needs to be simulated to determine whether it will work.  View the thread [http://groups.google.com/group/swarm-discuss/browse_thread/thread/b51f0d961fa37909 here], and if interested - please join the conversation!

==Concurrency==
Ian proposed examining "software transactional memory" as a way to prevent threads from interfering with each-other in bad ways.  This spawned a discussion on the pros and cons of various approaches.  Read the thread [http://groups.google.com/group/swarm-discuss/browse_thread/thread/9919e42e539e2c0a here].
